RashlyOutlaid
=============

Perform ASN whois queries against shadowserver.org

about
-----

 Performs whois queries against asn.shadowserver.org. If you query for a list of IP-addresses the library will perform a properly formated bulk query as described and required by the Shadowserver foundation.

The result is cached. If the peers property or the query property is changed, a new query will be executed when the result property is called. Subsequent calls to .result will only access the cached result.

```bash
# pip install RashlyOutlaid
